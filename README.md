# Bank-Loan-Analysis
This project involves analyzing a bank loan dataset and understanding the terminologies used in loan processing. The main objective is to identify key factors affecting loan approval, customer risk levels, and repayment behaviour using essential loan fields such as annual income, DTI, loan grade, employment details, and loan status.

🎯 ## Problem Statement
Banks need to assess borrower risk before approving a loan.
By analyzing customer details and loan performance, 
we aim to:
Identify high-risk vs low-risk borrowers
Understand what features impact loan defaults
Generate insights to improve loan approval decisions
Support data-driven risk management
